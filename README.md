### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Gnaneswara Sai! 

I'm currently pursuing my M.Tech in Computer Science at IISC Bangalore, specializing in recommendation systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). My research focuses on evaluating whether LLMs can outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning models in recommendation systems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my M.Tech project on recommendation systems using LLMs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in exploring the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and recommendation systems.
- ðŸ’» My skillset includes PyTorch, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, and more.
- ðŸ“š I enjoy learning about advancements in AI and contributing to open-source projects.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via [email](mailto:alokamgnaneswarasai@gmail.com.com) or connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnaneswara-sai-62615a218).
